- Paul Graham's main point in "How to Get Startup Ideas" is that you can't invent startup ideas, you have to be intimately involved in a problem space that you're passionate about.
- Living in the future and building things that are interesting can bridge gaps between the future and the present that don't exist.
- Becoming really good at noticing what's missing, what's wrong, and what's bad can help investigate problems further and develop solutions for them.
- Competition is often overestimated by young founders and having some competition can actually be a good sign of market demand.
- The "schlep filter" and "unsexy filter" can be good habits to clear roadblocks between you and a good idea, but they shouldn't be turned off just to have ideas.
- Algorithmically looking for demand and determining why some things are not there can be possible ways to have ideas.
