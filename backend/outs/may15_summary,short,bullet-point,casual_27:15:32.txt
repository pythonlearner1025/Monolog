- Main point of Paul Graham's "How to Get Startup Ideas": intimately involve yourself in a problem space you're passionate about and live in the future by building interesting things that bridge gaps between the future and the present
- Notice what's missing or can be done better and develop solutions for it
- Competition is overestimated by young founders and having some competition is actually a sign of a market
- Hard work and doing things others find unappealing can be valued and clear roadblocks to good ideas
