- Paul Graham's main point in How to Get Startup Ideas is that you should be intimately involved in a problem space that you're passionate about in order to come up with startup ideas.
- Living in the future and building things that are interesting can help bridge gaps between the future and the present that don't exist yet.
- You can develop solutions for problems by noticing what's missing or what could be done better.
- Competition is not always a bad thing for startups.
- The filters of not wanting to do dirty work or work that you personally find unappealing can be valuable in clearing roadblocks.
