- Create an outline feature for any blog generated to have a Wikipedia table of contents style pointer to the main topics covered.
- Live in the future and build things that are interesting to bridge gaps between the future and the present that don't exist, while becoming really good at noticing what's missing, what's wrong, what's bad and developing solutions for it.
- Spend time becoming the Zen master that's naturally able to create art because they're so at ease with themselves and love what they do to the point where they really want it to exist to the degree that most people don't.
- Not all competition is bad, and it's actually a sign that there's a market and people want your startup if there is competition.
- Hard work and doing things that other people don't want or normally find not interesting could be valued because people pay for you to rather do it than for you to do it yourself.
- Use good habits like the "schlep filter" and the "unsexy filter" to clear more roadblocks between you and coming up with a good idea, but don't turn them off just to have ideas.
