- Paul Graham's main point in "How to Get Startup Ideas" is to become intimately involved in a problem space that you're passionate about and to live in the future by building things that are interesting and bridge gaps between the future and present. 
- Noticing what's missing and developing solutions for it is key. 
- Competition is often overestimated and having some competition can be a sign of a market and demand. 
- The "schlep filter" and "unsexy filter" can lead to doing hard, valuable work that others do not want to do. 
- Good habits and clearing roadblocks can lead to better ideas, but caution against algorithmically looking for demand and using recipes.
