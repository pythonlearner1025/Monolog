- Paul Graham's main point in "How to Get Startup Ideas" is that you must be intimately involved in some problem space that you're passionate about, and you should aim to live in the future by building things that are interesting.
- Notice what's missing or could be done better in everyday life and investigate the problem further to develop solutions for it.

- Algorithmically looking for demand and trying to determine why some things are not there can be possible ways to have ideas.
