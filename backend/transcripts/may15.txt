So I just finished reading Paul Graham's How to Get Startup Ideas. And let me start with the reason for why I clicked on that article and began reading in the spirit of making intentions explicit, making desires explicit. To give context, I around now six hours ago, more like seven hours ago, I sat down and began working on building the prototype for a tool that answers simultaneously the research question of how can you predict people's desires and also my personal interest of how do you make a reading assistant tool. But at the same time going into this, there's also this thought process in the back burner of my head, which I explore through a lot of voice memos, which is how can you explore ideas best? And as a medium, what does speaking afford you? What does speaking afford in terms of generation of ideas, pruning of ideas? And also, but then I put that in the back in the in the back shelf and I was focusing more on reading and I guess more of thinking how, not really thinking actually, just building out a prototype with the goal of defining requirements for what the prototype would do. And I think I settled on the requirement of the prototype would, through a series of offering users interesting questions they might want to ask about bits and pieces of text and the user selecting out of the menu of options, it will learn iteratively about what the user is interested about while reading this article. And then it will come to pose better and better questions. And eventually it will come to do these extra side effect things like posing relevant articles that the reader might want to read, writing summaries about those articles so that they can scan it before they click on it. And also acting as sort of a recommender system, as I was just talking about. But I got to actually using or experimenting with this. So the idea of posing questions for certain pieces of text was the user would have to like highlight a chunk of text and then whatever chunk of text was highlighted would be used as context for an AI to generate questions based off it that the user could select and ask. And I tried that and all the questions, maybe it was because the quality of the AI is pretty bad, the questions were shit, they weren't insightful, they weren't really evoking discussion. And also I felt that it took away from the experience of really immersing in the reading itself and trying to understand the content well. I tried doing something else, which was instead of highlighting the text and generating questions off it, highlight the text and generate outlines, bullet point, sort of key point outlines so that I can, it basically converts the format into a different bullet point form, which is easier to read, in my opinion, easier and quicker to read. So I was speed reading side by side with left window, I had the original essay of Paul Graham's How to Start a Startup Hub. And on the right, I had a chat GPT open with the bullet points summarizing whatever I selected on the left screen. And I actually found that pretty useful and I can naturally use it like automatically to read the entirety of the essay without feeling like it really took away too much. And obviously this will differ case by case. But for something like trying to absorb information and get like needed information out quickly, sort of like in the exploration stages again, right? You're not trying to do too much deep reading. You just want to skim, skim, skim and identify interesting ideas. I think this could be very useful like as a lead generation tool. So outlines are useful and I also noticed and I had this idea that when you finish reading an article, there's this moment of like satisfaction about having had finished the article, but also a bit of sadness that this moment had come to an end, that your moment reading and processing this information has, it's closed, that, you know, it's come to an end, it's dead and done. And you're kind of left wanting more and wanting a continuation. We wish you could talk to the author a bit more. You wish you could ask questions, like Q&A follow up questions to the blog, whatever it is that he's written or like find sources that might give you convincing answers to your questions. So a thought is maybe at the end of the article, instead of like interfering in the middle, you could generate questions that you might ask as Q&A questions. But I have to also think about like, what's the point of doing that? Why am I generating Q&A questions? What is it that I want out of this? Do I want more of what the author has said? Because I am a person who wants to start a startup and these ideas are reassuring to me. Or is there a certain point that the author brought up that I am not totally convinced about and I want to lead onto it and do independent research to convince myself better? Or is there like some ideas that just popped up in my head and I want to explore them further separately, like in a totally separate context. So there's all these things that I could do. And there might be also a chance for me to like talk into a microphone like I'm doing now. Like almost try and recount what I've learned, my takeaways, my unique takeaways, personal takeaways from having read this article. So that through the process of articulating, I'm forced to recount knowledge and synthesize knowledge so that it's consolidated in my memory better than just reading it and forgetting. So even this exercise of me just talking about having read this article and what I took away from it, which I'll do in a bit, might help me remember it better and also generate more ideas based off it. So this again goes back to the point of engaging with the material more and going above just passive reading. So let me do that right now, actually. So Paul Graham, and honestly, it would be really good if there's like an outline page opened to the right of this essay so I can sort of have a pointer to all the main topics that he covered and I can refer back to them without having to pause and think about what he talked about, the sequence of his ideas and whatnot. But right now I'm just going to scroll. But yeah, one of the features that I think will be pretty important is like an outline feature for any blog generated such that like a Wikipedia table of contents. I think that'll be really good. So Paul Graham, main point of how to start a startup was or how to get a startup idea was you can't like invent startup ideas. You have to be intimately involved in some problem space that you're passionate about. And you have to be so far advanced in trying to solve the problem or playing with this new, interesting technology that you're literally almost living in the future because everyone else doesn't have this problem that you have or isn't using this thing that you are to the degree that you are using it because you are an outlier who has taken this thing to its conclusion, its extreme conclusion, and you're at the edges, the borderlands. And something that you should aim to do very simply is live in the future and build things that are interesting because by building things that are interesting, most likely you'll be bridging gaps between the future and the present that don't exist. So you might be doing some convoluted things using complex workflows like I'm doing right now to like read faster, to get ideas better, to help with the sort of exploration process of coming up with better ideas, and you're stitching together different technologies, you're jumping back and forth between ideas and building something concrete that a tool that helps you do it. That's like an instantiation of taking ideas and possibilities from the future and putting it into the present so that it's actually useful to certain types of people. And I think another key point of it was noticing how some things are just odd and off or could be done better just in the everyday life or in whatever things that go around. If you become really good at noticing what's missing, what's wrong, what's bad, you can sort of investigate the problem further, make the problem that someone else has your own, and develop solutions for it. And also I think his point, he sort of gave advice to people in school, which is that if you're in school, especially in college, don't spend time trying to learn entrepreneurship, how to start a company, all of that, because that's the easy part. The hard part is to sort of become the Zen master who's naturally able to create beautiful art because he's so at ease with himself such that it flows out of him. And I think that goes back to the point of living in the future, really being involved in the problem and just loving what you do to the point where you really want this thing, you really care about this thing existing to the degree that most people don't, which makes you sort of a different person. I think you had a tangent on competition, how competition is overestimated by young founders. Your startups rarely die because of high competition. It's actually better for you to have some competition because it's a sign that there's a market and people want this thing. And also he talked a bit about filters. There's an unsexy filter in the schlep filter, where the schlep filter is the filter of not wanting to do sort of dirty work. An unsexy filter is the filter of not wanting to do work that you personally find not appealing. And I think this is an example of how basically doing hard and doing things that other people don't want or other people normally don't find interesting and doing it really well could be valued because people pay for you to rather do it than you do it. But obviously you shouldn't turn these filters off, I think, just to have ideas. They should just be good habits to have because it might be clearing more roadblocks that might be in your way between you and coming up with a good idea and actually turning that thing into something that's useful. He cautions against recipes, but there are some possible ways to have ideas. Just like almost like algorithmically looking for demand, trying to determine why some things are just not there.
